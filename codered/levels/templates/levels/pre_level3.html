    <p>Greetings, agents, well done for making it this far. I must say, you're proving to be quite the challenge.
        But, let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still much to do and die. To that end, I have sent one of my
        associates to a location in Mumbai. He will have more information for you and will meet you at 18:00. I
        could tell you exactly where he will be waiting, but where's the fun in that? The challenge is for you to
        find him. To help you along, I'll give you a clue.<br><br>
        "Amidst the bustle and crowds of Mumbai's beating heart,
        A towering arch stands tall, an emblem of the past.
        Here, at the southernmost tip, where land meets sea,
        A rendezvous awaits at six, just you and me."<br><br>
        Use this clue wisely, agents. The clock is ticking, and time is running out. Good luck, you really need it. 
    </p>
