        You would be wondering why the four numbers? What shall we do with those? I will riddle you that
        “Four numbers that chug along, on tracks that lead to where you belong, the key to the next stage, lies with the trains that turn the page.”
        Here's another clue.
        Four digits to combine and a T9 code to apply, what's left is the same, but in a different shape.
