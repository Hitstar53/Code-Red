    <p>As you have reached this far, I must admit I am impressed. But don't think the game is over yet. I still
        want to see the city burn in flames. The next task will be even more enjoyable for me, but definitely
        not for you. Now that I have revealed the bomb's location, it's up to you to go find it. The question is,
        once you have found it, how will you defuse it? Keep in mind, it won't stop ticking on its own. One
        mistake, and the entire city will be blown to smithereens. So, the question is, are you ready to defuse
        the bomb?
